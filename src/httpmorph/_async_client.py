TrueAsyncClient - Truly asynchronous HTTP client using httpmorph's async I/O engine

This demonstrates the async I/O capabilities without thread pool overhead.
Full asyncio integration will be added in future iterations.

    """
    HTTP client with true async I/O (no thread pool)

    This is a demonstration of the async I/O architecture implemented in Phase B.
    The C-level async request state machine is fully implemented with:
    - Non-blocking connect()
    - Non-blocking TLS handshake
    - Non-blocking send/receive
    - I/O engine with epoll/kqueue
    - Async request manager for multiple concurrent requests

    Current Status:
    - ✅ C-level async I/O engine complete
    - ✅ Async request state machine complete
    - ✅ Request manager complete
    - ⏳ Python asyncio bindings (placeholder)
    - ⏳ DNS resolution (placeholder)

    Usage (future):
        async with TrueAsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get('https://example.com')
            print(response.status_code)

        3. Register FD with asyncio event loop (add_reader/add_writer)
        4. Wait for I/O events without blocking
        5. Step state machine on each event
        6. Return response when complete

        Current implementation is a placeholder demonstrating the architecture.
        Full implementation requires Cython bindings to be completed.

Async I/O Architecture (Phase B Complete)
==========================================

Phase B Days 1-3: ✅ COMPLETE

1. I/O Engine (src/core/io_engine.c)
   - epoll support for Linux (edge-triggered)
   - kqueue support for macOS/BSD (one-shot)
   - Platform-agnostic API
   - Socket helpers (non-blocking, performance opts)
   - Operation helpers (connect, recv, send)

2. Async Request State Machine (src/core/async_request.c)
   - 9-state machine: INIT → DNS → CONNECT → TLS → SEND → RECV_HEADERS → RECV_BODY → COMPLETE
   - Non-blocking at every stage
   - Proper SSL_WANT_READ/WANT_WRITE handling
   - Timeout tracking
   - Error handling
   - Reference counting

3. Request Manager (src/core/async_request_manager.c)
   - Track multiple concurrent requests
   - Request ID generation
   - Event loop integration
   - Thread-safe operations

Phase B Days 4-5: ⏳ IN PROGRESS

4. Python Asyncio Integration (this file)
   - Cython bindings for async APIs
   - Event loop integration (add_reader/add_writer)
   - TrueAsyncClient class (this file)
   - Example applications

Architecture Benefits:
- No thread pool overhead (currently 1-2ms per request)
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent connections
- Sub-millisecond async overhead
- Efficient resource usage (320KB per request vs 8MB per thread)
- Native event loop integration

Performance Targets:
- Latency: 100-200μs overhead (vs 1-2ms with thread pool)
- Concurrency: 10K+ simultaneous requests (vs 100-200 with threads)
- Memory: 320KB per request (vs 8MB per thread)
- Throughput: 2-5x improvement over thread pool approach
